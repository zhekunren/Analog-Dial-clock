# Analog_Clock-_Based_On_Stm32

## Description
This design is based on HAL library and uses STM32F1 to design a dial clock, which can switch six states through the state machine,including display main menu, display current clock, standard current time, set alarm, alarm time, view information. The clock is generated by the internal RTC of the MCU, and the time is shown in the form of a dial pointer.

## Files
The code ``Clock-v0.0`` under the folder ``./Code`` and the hardware file ``Clock_原理图.pdf`` under the folder ``./Hardware`` are designed by Chewsern.  
The code ``Clock-v0.1`` under the folder ``./Code`` and the hardware file ``Clock_原理图2.png`` under the folder ``./Hardware`` are my modified files.
